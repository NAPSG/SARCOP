# SAR Common Operating Platform (SARCOP)
(Formerly known as SARandFirstResponderSurvey)
This is a GitHub page for recording and resolving issues related to the Wide Area Search Templates for waypoints (points), tracklogs (lines), and assignments / incident areas (polygons). We have largley moved to MS Teams and MS Planner for logging enhancements, but GitHub can still be used to report issues (e.g., bugs and configuration errors).
